Sales Forecasting Project

Overview

This project focuses on forecasting daily sales using Python and machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze past sales data and predict future trends to help businesses make informed decisions.

Features

Reads sales data from a CSV file.

Uses a rolling average method to forecast sales.

Calculates error metrics like Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

Generates comparison values between actual and forecasted sales.

Plots sales trends for visualization.

Saves forecasted sales data to a CSV file.

Includes a script to generate sample sales data.

Technologies Used

Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn)

Machine Learning (Rolling Average Forecasting)

Data Visualization (Matplotlib)

File Handling (CSV)
